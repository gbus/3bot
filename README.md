"3Bot" is a 3 wheel mobile platform based on raspberry pi and the camera module, the brain and eye of the robot. 
The head is mounted on a two joints backbone to allow the camera to go up and forward.
The code is a collection of libraries and diagrams used to design and control the robot. 
The aim is to remotely control the robot with http rest functions and allow the remote user to explore the environment 3bot is in.
